## 🧠 Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using behavioral and demographic data.  
It includes everything from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### 🔍 Project Highlights

- 🔹 Data cleaning & transformation  
- 🔹 Feature engineering (e.g. AQ score summation, age binning)  
- 🔹 Class imbalance handling using oversampling  
- 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🔹 Model building with Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost  
- 🔹 ROC-AUC based model evaluation
